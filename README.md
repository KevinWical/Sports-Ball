## Setup Instructions

### 1. Fork or Clone This Repository

You'll need to set up email credentials. The easiest approach is using Gmail with an App Password:

2. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App passwords
   - Generate a password for "Mail"
3. **Use these settings**:
   - SMTP Server: `smtp.gmail.com`
   - SMTP Port: `587`
   - Sender Email: Your Gmail address
   - Sender Password: The app password you generated

#### Option B: Other Email Providers

- **Outlook/Hotmail**: `smtp-mail.outlook.com:587`
- **Yahoo**: `smtp.mail.yahoo.com:587`
- **Custom SMTP**: Use your provider's SMTP settings

### 3. Set Up GitHub Secrets

In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions** and add these secrets:
